Learning Progressive Adaptation for Multi-Modal Tracking (PATrack)
=
We propose to perform Progressive Adaptation for Multi-Modal Tracking (PATrack). Our design integrates intra-modal, inter-modal, and task-level adapters into a unified framework. Extensive experiments on RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and RGB+Event tracking tasks demonstrate that our method shows impressive performance.
